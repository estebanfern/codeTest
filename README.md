1. Balanced group symbols: 
Write a balancedGroupSymbols function that takes a string as input and returns a
boolean. The string argument containts group symbols that are well known for
mathematical operations, and consists of: Parentheses “()”, Brackets “[]” and Braces
“{}”.
If the group symbols in the input string are ‘well balanced’, then return true, else return
false.
For example, the program should produce:
true for expression = “[()]{}{()()}”
false for expression = “[(])”
